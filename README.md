This is a 3-Dimensional Political Compass, which means there is an extra axis added to the regular political compass to make results more reliable.
The three axes are Cultural, Economic and Authority and you may vary from left to right on each of these.

If you have suggestions or complaints about the code, the questions or how the axes are structured please feel free to leave a comment.

This is more of a fun project than something serious (seeing as I wrote this in python) but I will be using it to conduct research eventually.

Goals:
 - Add more axes to the compass
 - Keep questions coming from an a-political stance

FAQ
How do you keep the questions a-political?
  I use chatGPT 3.5 to give me the questions and specifically request it to leave all political biases out of the formation, although it is inevitable that some of the questions may appear left or right leaning.

Did you use chatGPT to write the code?
  Despite using chatGPT to generate the questions, I try my best to do most of the coding myself, which means errors may occur. I do sometimes use chatGPT to solve some of my problems but for the most part I try to use my own skills
